# Holaboss Local - Neon AI Workspace Prototype

Desktop prototype inspired by a futuristic dark neon-green AI operating workspace with three docked panes:

1. File Explorer (left)
2. In-app Browser panel (center)
3. AI Chat assistant (right)

Built with Electron + React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- Electron main/preload/renderer separation with secure preload bridge
- Full-window dark neon-green visual system
- Global top tab bar with workspace controls
- Three-pane layout with draggable split handles
- Pane widths persist in local storage
- Real local file explorer (reads your filesystem via secure IPC)
- Real embedded Chromium browser (`<webview>`) with URL/home/back/forward/refresh
- AI chat panel with suggestion pills, composer, user/assistant bubbles, and local rule-based responses

## Tech Stack

- Electron
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Lucide React icons

## Run

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
GITHUB_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" npm run prepare:runtime
npm run dev
```

This launches:
- Vite dev server for the renderer (`http://localhost:5173`)
- TS build watcher for Electron main/preload (`out/dist-electron/*.cjs`)
- Electron desktop window with live restarts on main/preload changes

Internal backend preset entrypoints:

```bash
# internal-only preset hook for local backend env
npm run dev:cp:local

# internal-only preset hook for shared dev backend env
npm run dev:cp:dev

# production/default env
npm run dev:cp:prod
```

The repo does not ship remote endpoint URLs. Remote auth/backend access is configured entirely through environment variables outside the public repo. Local/dev backend overrides are only honored when `HOLABOSS_INTERNAL_DEV=1` is set or when running the unpackaged dev app through the internal preset scripts above.

Before running `npm run dev`, copy `desktop/.env.example` to `desktop/.env` and fill in the required remote values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

`prepare:runtime` downloads the latest runtime bundle for the current host platform from GitHub Releases and stages it into `out/runtime-<platform>/`.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates:
- Renderer production bundle in `out/dist/`
- Electron main/preload bundles in `out/dist-electron/`

## Runtime Bundle

Production mac builds expect a staged runtime bundle at `out/runtime-macos/`. On macOS, you can stage it with:

```bash
npm run prepare:runtime
```

On Linux, the same command stages `out/runtime-linux/` automatically. If you need to override the detected platform explicitly:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" HOLABOSS_RUNTIME_PLATFORM=linux npm run prepare:runtime
```

For local development against unreleased `hola-boss-oss` runtime changes:

```bash
# optional when your OSS repo is not ../hola-boss-oss
export HOLABOSS_OSS_ROOT=/absolute/path/to/hola-boss-oss

# builds the runtime bundle for the current host platform and stages it into out/runtime-<platform>
npm run prepare:runtime:local
```

After `npm run prepare:runtime:local`, a normal `npm run dev` uses that staged local runtime bundle. Set `HOLABOSS_RUNTIME_PLATFORM=macos|linux|windows` if you need to override platform detection.

Or package directly with local runtime in one step:

```bash
npm run dist:mac:local
```

The staging script accepts one of:
- `HOLABOSS_RUNTIME_DIR=/absolute/path/to/runtime-macos`
- `HOLABOSS_RUNTIME_TARBALL=/absolute/path/to/holaboss-runtime-macos-<sha>.tar.gz`
- `HOLABOSS_RUNTIME_BUNDLE_URL=https://.../holaboss-runtime-macos-<sha>.tar.gz`
- `HOLABOSS_GITHUB_TOKEN=...` or `GITHUB_TOKEN=...` to fetch the latest release asset from GitHub Releases
- `HOLABOSS_RUNTIME_PLATFORM=macos|linux|windows` to override the auto-detected target platform when needed

If none are set, it falls back to `/tmp/holaboss-runtime-macos-full` when present.

To build a mac app bundle with the runtime embedded in Electron resources:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" npm run dist:mac
```

Use `dist:mac` when you want the latest released macOS runtime. Use `dist:mac:local` for local unreleased runtime code.

This produces an unsigned local mac app bundle with `runtime-macos` embedded in `Contents/Resources/`.

Output:
- [Holaboss Workspace.app](/Users/jeffrey/Desktop/hola-boss-oss/desktop/out/release/mac-arm64/Holaboss%20Workspace.app)

Run packaged app with endpoint presets:

```bash
# internal-only local override
npm run packaged:run:local

# internal-only dev override
npm run packaged:run:dev

# production default
npm run packaged:run:prod
```

Remote configuration:
- `HOLABOSS_AUTH_BASE_URL` for Better Auth session endpoint
- `HOLABOSS_AUTH_SIGN_IN_URL` for the hosted sign-in page
- `HOLABOSS_BACKEND_BASE_URL` for the Holaboss backend base URL used by the desktop
- `HOLABOSS_INTERNAL_DEV=1` to allow non-production backend overrides in packaged runs
- `HOLABOSS_PACKAGED_APP_BIN` for an explicit packaged binary path

Start by copying the template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Optional internal-only overrides:
- `HOLABOSS_PROJECTS_URL`
- `HOLABOSS_MARKETPLACE_URL`
- `HOLABOSS_PROACTIVE_URL`

The preset scripts no longer embed concrete URLs. Internal developers are expected to source the backend URL from a private shell profile, `.envrc`, CI secret, or another non-public config mechanism before running the preset scripts.

To build a mac installer image:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" npm run dist:mac:dmg
```

This produces a local-use `.dmg` installer in `out/release/`.

Notes:
- `dist:mac` builds an unpacked `.app`
- `dist:mac:dmg` builds a `.dmg` installer
- both local mac packaging commands force ad-hoc signing for local smoke testing via `--config.mac.identity=-`
- production signing and notarization are handled in GitHub Actions once the Apple secrets are configured

### Signed Product Release

Signed macOS distribution is handled by the manual `.github/workflows/release-macos-desktop.yml` workflow. Normal pushes continue to run CI and publish runtime bundles separately; the signed DMG is only built when you explicitly trigger the desktop release workflow.

The desktop release workflow requires these repository secrets and fails fast when any of them are missing:

- `MAC_CERTIFICATE`: base64-encoded `Developer ID Application` `.p12`
- `MAC_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`: password for the `.p12`
- `APPLE_ID`: Apple Developer account email
- `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`: app-specific password from Apple ID settings
- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`: Apple Developer Team ID

When triggering the workflow, provide:

- `ref`: the branch, tag, or commit you want to ship
- `release_tag`: the GitHub release tag to create or update
- `release_title`: optional display title for the GitHub release
- `prerelease`: whether the GitHub release should be marked as a prerelease when first created

The workflow builds a matching macOS runtime bundle from that ref, maps the Apple secrets to `electron-builder`'s `CSC_LINK`, `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`, and Apple notarization environment variables, then uploads the signed DMG to the chosen GitHub release. The desktop build config uses `hardenedRuntime` plus an explicit mac entitlements plist at `resources/entitlements.mac.plist`.

After a signed build, validate the produced app locally with:

```bash
codesign --verify --deep --strict --verbose=2 /path/to/Holaboss.app
spctl -a -vv -t exec /path/to/Holaboss.app
xcrun stapler validate /path/to/Holaboss.app
```

## Browser Notes

The center pane uses a real Electron `webview`:
- Source is set in `src/components/panes/BrowserPane.tsx`
- Navigation controls call real webview methods (`goBack`, `goForward`, `reload`, `loadURL`)
- Main process enables and guards webview attachment in `electron/main.ts`

If you later want a multi-tab browser architecture, keep the current `BrowserPane` control surface and swap to a tab manager that creates one webview per tab.

## File Explorer Notes

The left pane reads real directories from your machine:
- IPC handler lives in `electron/main.ts` (`fs:listDirectory`)
- Renderer call lives in preload bridge (`window.electronAPI.fs.listDirectory`)
- UI and navigation are in `src/components/panes/FileExplorerPane.tsx`

The explorer currently supports:
- folder open (double-click or “Open Selected Folder”)
- back/forward/up/home navigation
- search/filter in current directory
- grouped rendering by modified date (Today / This Week / This Year / Earlier)

### AI assistant

Current chat replies are local rule-based mocks (no backend/LLM):
- Rules and canned responses live in `src/utils/mockAssistant.ts`
- `ChatPane.tsx` handles message rendering and send flow

Replace point for real AI backend:
- Hook send flow in `src/components/panes/ChatPane.tsx` where `generateMockReply` is called
- Replace timeout mock with API call and stream/append tokens as needed

## Security

Renderer runs with:
- `contextIsolation: true`
- `nodeIntegration: false`
- `webviewTag: true` (enabled intentionally for embedded browser pane)

Preload bridge exposes runtime info and a constrained filesystem API via `window.electronAPI`.

## Stretch Goals Ready

Codebase is structured to support later additions such as:
- draggable top tabs
- command palette
- collapsible icon rail
- tokenized theme switching
