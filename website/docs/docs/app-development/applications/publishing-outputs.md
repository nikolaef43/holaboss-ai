# Publishing Outputs

Workspace outputs are durable runtime records that make an app's work visible outside the app itself.

The source of truth is:

- `sdk/bridge/src/workspace-outputs.ts`
- `sdk/bridge/src/presentation.ts`
- `sdk/bridge/src/turn-context.ts`
- `sdk/bridge/test/workspace-outputs.test.ts`

## There Are Two Publishing Paths

| Use case | Helper |
| --- | --- |
| Durable workspace-visible record | `createAppOutput()` and `updateAppOutput()` |
| Artifact tied to the current assistant turn | `publishSessionArtifact()` |

Use outputs for durable operator-facing state. Use session artifacts for results that should appear under the active assistant turn.

## When Publishing Is Available

The bridge only publishes when it can resolve:

- a workspace API URL
- an active workspace id

That comes from:

- `WORKSPACE_API_URL`, or a URL derived from the integration broker URL
- `HOLABOSS_WORKSPACE_ID`

If publishing is unavailable, the helpers return `null` instead of breaking local development.

## Durable Workspace Outputs

```ts
import { createAppOutput, updateAppOutput } from "@holaboss/bridge";

const output = await createAppOutput({
  outputType: "draft_post",
  title: draft.title,
  moduleId: "twitter",
  moduleResourceId: draft.id,
  status: "queued",
  metadata: {
    view: "drafts",
  },
});

if (output) {
  await updateAppOutput(output.id, {
    status: "published",
    moduleResourceId: published.id,
  });
}
```

Current helper behavior:

- `createAppOutput()` sends `workspace_id`, `output_type`, `title`, `module_id`, `module_resource_id`, `platform`, and `metadata`
- if you request a non-`draft` status, the helper creates first and patches immediately
- `updateAppOutput()` only sends fields you actually changed
- both helpers throw on non-`2xx` API responses

## Session Artifacts

Use `publishSessionArtifact()` when the result belongs to the active assistant turn.

```ts
import {
  publishSessionArtifact,
  resolveHolabossTurnContext,
} from "@holaboss/bridge";

const turn = resolveHolabossTurnContext(request.headers);

if (turn) {
  await publishSessionArtifact(turn, {
    artifactType: "draft_post",
    externalId: draft.id,
    title: draft.title,
    moduleId: "twitter",
    moduleResourceId: draft.id,
    metadata: {
      stage: "draft",
    },
  });
}
```

`publishSessionArtifact()` writes to `/api/v1/agent-sessions/:sessionId/artifacts` and supports:

- `artifactType`
- `externalId`
- `title`
- `moduleId`
- `moduleResourceId`
- `platform`
- `metadata`
- optional `artifactId`
- optional `changeType`

The same session-artifact surface is also what the runtime now uses for first-class report artifacts. Runtime-managed `write_report` artifacts are persisted as session outputs with `artifact_type: "report"`, so app code should not create a duplicate artifact for the same report just because it also wrote a file.

## Recovering Turn Context

`resolveHolabossTurnContext(headers)` reads:

- `x-holaboss-workspace-id`
- `x-holaboss-session-id`
- `x-holaboss-input-id`

If the workspace header is missing, it falls back to `HOLABOSS_WORKSPACE_ID`. If the workspace id or session id cannot be resolved, it returns `null`.

That behavior is deliberate: artifact publishing should only happen when the request is actually associated with a turn.

## Resource Presentation

When an output or artifact should reopen a specific app resource, attach a stable presentation shape:

```ts
import { buildAppResourcePresentation } from "@holaboss/bridge";

const presentation = buildAppResourcePresentation({
  view: "drafts",
  path: `/drafts/${draft.id}`,
});
```

The helper normalizes `path` so it always starts with `/`.

## Production Rules

- persist your app's canonical local record before publishing
- treat `null` as "publishing unavailable here", not success
- use workspace outputs for durable state an operator should revisit
- use session artifacts for turn-scoped visibility
- update outputs as the real app record changes status

## Validation

```bash
npm run sdk:bridge:test
```
